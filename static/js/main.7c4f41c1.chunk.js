And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.","If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.","We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.","Substitute 'damn' every time you're inclined to write 'very;' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.","If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.","One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.","Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.","You never have to change anything you got up in the middle of the night to write.","No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise in the writer, no surprise in the reader.","Read, read, read. Read everything\u200a--\u200atrash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good, you'll find out.

You read and you're pierced.","How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.","I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.","A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.","Let me live, love, and say it well in good sentences.","Here is a lesson in creative writing. First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.","Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.","I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read, one to write in.","You can make anything by writing.","A word after a word after a word is power.","Tears are words that need to be written.","You should write because you love the shape of stories and sentences and the creation of different words on a page. Writing comes from reading, and reading is the finest teacher of how to write.","Writing is like sex. First you do it for love, then you do it for your friends, and then you do it for money.","To survive, you must tell stories."],v='"--Madeleine L\'Engle","--Stephen King","--Ana\xefs Nin","--Mark Twain","--Toni Morrison","--Jack Kerouac: The Dharma Bums","--Benjamin Franklin","--Saul Bellow","--Robert Frost","--William Faulkner","--Ray Bradbury: Zen in the Art of Writing","--Aldous Huxley: Brave New World","--Henry David Thoreau","--Anne Frank","--Thomas Mann: Essays of Three Decades","--Sylvia Plath: The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath","--Kurt Vonnegut Jr.: A Man Without a Country","--Franz Kafka","--Robert Louis Stevenson","--C.S.
